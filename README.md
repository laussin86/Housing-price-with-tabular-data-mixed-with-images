#project scope

We tried to solve the issue of the rapid increase of house price or rent in Ontario so people can anticipate when it is the best time to buy or invest in a home. To resolve that, I will build a ML model based on the past market behavior and what features impact the price changes to predict when it is the best time to buy or invest and which part of the province.
